As Fred Brooks put it in *The Mythical Man Month*:

> "Where a new system concept or new technology is used, one has to build a system to throw away, for even the best planning is not so omniscient as to get it right the first time. Hence plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow."

This is the one we threw away. Some things worked well, some things didn't. We learned a vast amount about how to build it better, and are the process of doing so.

Our second version is well underway and in amazing shape. We're all very proud of it - it's quite a codebase. It's open source, but the GitHub repo will remain closed until after SoutheastCon (May 15th, 2014).
